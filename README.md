This is a Python script that creates a wireless hotspot that people can pay in Bitcoin to access for a predetermined amount of time.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, you will need the following:

A computer running Windows with Wi-Fi capabilities that can act as a wireless hotspot.
A Bitcoin wallet to receive payments. You can use a service like Coinbase, BitPay, or BlockChain to create a wallet and generate a payment address.
A payment gateway that can process Bitcoin payments. There are various payment gateway providers such as BitPay, Coinbase Commerce, and CoinPayments that you can use to accept Bitcoin payments.
A way to connect the payment gateway to your Python script. You will need to use the payment gateway's API to create a payment request and check for payment confirmation in your script.
A way to host the Python script and expose it to the internet. You can use a cloud service provider like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure to host the script and create a public endpoint for it.
An SSL certificate to encrypt the communication between the client and the server. You can use a free service like Let's Encrypt to obtain an SSL certificate for your domain.
Usage
Clone the repository or download the Python script to your computer.
Edit the script to update the parameters for the hotspot and payment gateway (e.g., SSID, password, payment URL, API key, etc.).
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
Connect to the wireless hotspot using the SSID and password specified in the script.
Open a web browser and navigate to the payment URL to make a payment using Bitcoin.
Once payment has been confirmed, the script will grant access to the wireless hotspot for the predetermined amount of time.
